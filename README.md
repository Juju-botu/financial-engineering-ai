This repository collects projects for the course IE471 "Introduction to Financial Engineering" at KAIST.

Here is the list of projects:
1. Stock market prediction

## Stock market prediction
We want to predict Samsung's adjusted closing stock price for 2019-2020 with data observations from 2000 to 2018. We experiment with LSTM and GRU models.
Moreover, we predict the latest Microsoft and Tesla stocks: the latter is particularly difficult given the new skyrocketing of this Elon Musk's company.
